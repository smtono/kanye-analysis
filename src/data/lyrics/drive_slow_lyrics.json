The day his father passed away\nLeft him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'\nAl B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy\nHit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy\nHit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty\nBoned so much that summer, even had him a baby\nSee back\u2014 back then\u2014 then, if you had a car\nYou was the Chi-Town version of Baby\nAnd I was just a virgin, a baby\nOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazy\nI used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\nFelt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked\nWe'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall\nThey had them Lincolns and Au-rurr-ras, we was hurting 'em all\nWith the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dog\u2014\nFuck all that flirting\u2014now, I'm tryna get in some drawers\nSo put me on with these hoes, homie\nHe told me, \"Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie\"\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nDrive slow, homie\n(Drive slow)\nYou never know, homie, about these hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\n\n[Verse 2: Paul Wall]\nWhat it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving\nThe candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing\nThem elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac\nTrunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth, relaxed\nI'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies\nAllow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes\nIt's a star-studded event when I valet park\nOpen up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark\nYou see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?\nThe disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'\nI'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab\nBut I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab\nA young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla\nRidin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar\nI'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw\nI'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]\nTurn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes\nDrive slow, homie\nIf you're riding around the city with nowhere to go\nDrive slow, homie\nLive today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know\nYou never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\nYou might also like[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]\nMy car's like the movie, my car's like the crib\nI got more TVs in here than where I live\nAnd that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit\nAnd everything I flip, you know it's something serious\nI got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims\nI got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence\nYou see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced\nThat you should go on and kiss it, just a lil' bit (Just a lil' bit)\nI wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain\nMy canaries is gleaming through my angel wings\nThey see me, hoes actin like they seen a king\nWith that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green\nMy woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues\nMy cylinder quiet, like tiptoes\nI sold O's, and this I know\nWhen you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow\n\n[Bridge: Tony Williams]\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nOh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh\nMm, hm\nOh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh\nMm, mm, mm, mm\n[Outro: Kanye West & Tony Williams]\nYeah\nB-boom, b-boom-boom\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nDrive slow, homie\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nDrive slow, homie\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nYou never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie\nMm, hm\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\nDrive slow, homie51Embed"
