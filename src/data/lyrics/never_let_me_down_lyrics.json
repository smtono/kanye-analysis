Ivy (Traduzione Italiana)Never Let Me Down Lyrics[Intro: Jay-Z]\nOh baby\nTurn the motherfuckin' music up\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I've found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nYo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts\nFirst I had they ear, now I have they heart\nRappers came and went, I've been here from the start\nI seen them put it together, watched them take it apart\nSeen the Rovers roll up with ribbons\nI seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven\nSo when I reload, he holds number one position\nWhen you hot, I'm hot\nAnd when your feet cold, mines is sizzling\nIt's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me\n'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life\nThis is not an image, this is God-given\nThis is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'\nIt's the most consistent, Hov\nGive you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and\nNigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'\nIt's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap\nI'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy\n[Chorus]\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I've found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI get down for my grandfather who took my momma\nMade her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat\nAt the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins\nAnd with that in my blood I was born to be different\nNow niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership\nBut we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership\nThat's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it\nRacism still alive, they just be concealin' it\nBut I know they don't want me in the damn club\nThey even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club\nI done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed\nSwear I've been baptized 'least three or four times\nBut in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid\nIt's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved\nLike it take a lot more than durags to get you waves\nNothing sad as that day my girl father passed away\nSo I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter\nAnd you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up\nAnd I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her\nAnd you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up\nBut I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye\n'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye\nFirst Aaliyah now Romeo must die\nI know I got angels watching me from the other side\n[Chorus]\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I've found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\n[Verse 3: J. Ivy]\nWe are all here for a reason on a particular path\nYou don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math\nCats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious\nThat's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world\nI'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls\nI'm not just another individual\nMy spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual\nBut I get my hymns from Him\nSo it's not me, it's He that's lyrical\nI'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument\nMy rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental\nThat's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into\nYeah I need my loot by rent day\nBut that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte\nI'm trying to get us \"us free\" like Cinque\nI can't stop, that's why I'm hot\nDetermination, dedication, motivation\nI'm talking to you of my many inspirations\nWhen I say I can't let you or self down\nIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff\nAnd if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life\nIn my grip, I would never ever let you down\nAnd when these words are found\nLet it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love\nThat's why my breath is felt by the deaf\nAnd while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind\nI too dream in color and in rhyme\nSo I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house\n'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth\nA touch of God reigns out\nTake 'em to church\n[Chorus]\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get down\n[Verse 4: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]\nWho else you know been hot this long?\n(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)\nStarted from nothing but he got this strong\n(The Roc is in the building)\nBuilt the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you\nPedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)\nLet you tell it, man, I'm falling\nWell, somebody must have caught him\n'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em\nNumber one albums, what I got? Like four of them\nMore of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way\nClear the way, I'm here to stay\nY'all can save the chitter chat, this and that\nThis is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced\nWhen I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious\nSix Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'\nYoung, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas\nThe way y'all all follow Jigga\nHov's a living legend and I'll tell you why\nEverybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive88Embed"
