His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!\n\n[Intro]\nYo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?\nCan they, Hop?\n\n[Chorus: Chaka Khan]\nThrough the fire, to the limit, to the wall\nFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n[Over Chorus]\nI spit it through the wire, man\nThere's too much stuff on my heart right now, man\nI'd gladly risk it all right now\nIt's a life-or-death situation, man\nY'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man\nIt's your boy, Kanye to the\u2026\nChi-Town, what's goin' on?\nUh-huh, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nI drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert\nSomebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp\nThat right there could drive a sane man berserk\nNot to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk\nHow do you console my mom or give her light support\nTellin' her her son's on life support?\nAnd just imagine how my girl feel\nOn the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till\nShe was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine\nShe a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign\nNo use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed\nTryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines\nIn the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died\nThe doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man\nStory on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band\nI swear, this right here, history in the makin', man\nYou might also like[Chorus: Chaka Khan]\nThrough the fire, to the limit, to the wall\nFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n\n[Over Chorus]\nI really apologize for everything right now\nIf it's unclear at all, man\nThey got my mouth wired shut\nFor like\u2026 I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks\nY'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw\nI looked in the mirror\nAnd half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man\nI couldn't believe it\nBut I'm still here for y'all right now, man\nThis what I got to say right here, dawg\nYeah, turn me up, yeah, uh\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal\nOn the hottest rap label around?\nBut he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds\nIt was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?\nAnd he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory\nAnd what we need to do in the game\nGood dude, bad night, right place, wrong time\nIn the blink of a eye, his whole life changed\nIf you could feel how my face felt\nYou would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)\nThank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt\nI swear to God, driver two wanna sue\nI got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe\nMy dawgs couldn't tell if I\u2026\nI looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised\nThere's been an accident like GEICO\nThey thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael\nI must got a angel, \u2018cause look how death missed his ass\nUnbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?\nLook back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past\nToys \"R\" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash\nAnd I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid\nSwear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did\nBut I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph\nMake music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire\n[Chorus: Chaka Khan]\nThrough the fire, to the limit, to the wall\nFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n\n[Over Chorus]\nY'know what I'm sayin'?\nWhen the doctor told me I had, um\nThat I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin\nI said, \"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?\"\n\"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!\"\nYou can't be serious, man133Embed"
