You where I am!\"\nA hip-hop legend\nI think I died in that accident, \u2018cause this must be Heaven\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nI gotta testify\nCome up in the spot lookin' extra fly\n'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky\nGotta testify\nCome up in the spot lookin' extra fly\n'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]\nNow let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh\n(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)\nA-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh\n(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)\nNow let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh\n(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)\nA-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh\n(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nBack when Gucci was the shit to rock\nBack when Slick Rick got the shit to pop\nI'd do anything to say I got it\nDamn, them new loafers hurt my pocket\nBefore anybody wanted K. West beats\nMe and my girl split the buffet at KFC\nDog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns\nLike \"Man, these niggas that much better than me?\"\nBaby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane\nAnd I don't know if I'll be back again\nSure enough, I sent the plane tickets\nBut when she came to kick it, things became different\nAny girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on\nCouldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long\nI'm tryin' to right my wrongs\nBut it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kanye West]\nI gotta testify\nCome up in the spot lookin' extra fly\n'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky\nYou gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify\nCome up in the spot lookin' extra fly\n'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nYes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?\nLupe steal like Lupin the 3rd\nHere like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb\nPeachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge\nLet's slow it down like we're on the syrup\nBottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth\nBut, before you say another word\nI'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street\nI'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra\nBut I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde\nOr touch\u00e9, Lupe cool as the unthawed\nBut I still feel possessed as a gun charge\nCome as correct as a porn star\nIn a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car\nSo, I represent the first\nNow let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nI gotta testify\nCome up in the spot lookin' extra fly\n'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky\nYou gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify\nCome up in the spot lookin' extra fly\n'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky\n\n[Outro: Kanye West]\nWe back at home, baby!\nSky high, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sky high!\nI\u2019m, I\u2019m sky high!\nI\u2019m, I\u2019m sky high!\nI\u2019m, I\u2019m sky high!\nI\u2019m, I\u2019m sky high!\nSky, sky high!
